await notifyTaskAssigned(
  taskTitle,
  assignedToEmployeeId,
  assignerName
);

// Get all active employees
const { data: employees } = await supabase
  .from('employees')
  .select('id')
  .eq('is_active', true);

const employeeIds = employees.map(e => e.id);

await notifyEmergencyAlert(
  "Evacuation required - Fire alarm activated",
  employeeIds
);
```

---

## 🔧 Extending the System

### Adding New Notification Types:

1. **Add function to `notificationService.ts`:**
```typescript
export const notifyCustomEvent = async (
  message: string,
  employeeIds: string[]
) => {
  return sendPushNotification({
    title: '🎯 Custom Event',
    body: message,
    employeeIds: employeeIds,
    data: {
      action: 'custom_event',
      url: '/custom-page'
    }
  });
};
```

2. **Import and use in component:**
```typescript
import { notifyCustomEvent } from '@/lib/notificationService';

// In your function
await notifyCustomEvent(
  "Your custom message",
  [employeeId]
);
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Notifications

### 1. **Test Single Notification:**
```typescript
// In browser console or component
import { notifyTaskAssigned } from '@/lib/notificationService';

await notifyTaskAssigned(
  "Test Task",
  "employee-id",
  "Test Manager"
);
```

### 2. **Test Permission Status:**
```typescript
// Check notification permission
console.log('Notification permission:', Notification.permission);

// Request permission
await Notification.requestPermission();
```

### 3. **Test Service Worker:**
```typescript
// Check if service worker is registered
navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(reg => {
  console.log('Service Worker ready:', reg);
  
  // Check push subscription
  reg.pushManager.getSubscription().then(sub => {
    console.log('Push subscription:', sub);
  });
});
```

### 4. **Manual Test Notification:**
```typescript
// Send test notification directly
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator && 'PushManager' in window) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(reg => {
    reg.showNotification('Test Notification', {
      body: 'This is a test message',
      icon: '/icons/android-launchericon-192-192.png',
      badge: '/icons/android-launchericon-96-96.png',
      actions: [
        { action: 'view', title: 'View' },
        { action: 'dismiss', title: 'Dismiss' }
      ]
    });
  });
}
```
